# Guess-the-number-with-voice-assistant

I was bored so thought why dont make a easy game but then i was like lets do something different for this game..
Not the usual keyboard inputs game ..

To run this project in your system you have to install few modules.

You can install by running following commands in your Windows Powershell

```
pip install pyttsx3
pip install speechRecognition
pip install pyAudio
```

There you go ,You can play with the game now without touching keyboard.
